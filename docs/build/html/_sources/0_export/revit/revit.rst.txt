Content Preparation:
=====================================

Location and Model Info.
---------------------------------------------


Lux Walker imports your location information from your Revit file. This allows for correct lighting and seasonal conditions for your project.

To do this you need to correctly set up your projects location and project north within your Revit project.

Steps:
In Revit Click:  Manage tab>Project Location panel> Location.
In the Location Weather and Site dialog, click the Location tab.
Specify the project location using one of these methods:
•	 Default City List:
•	 Nearest major city. For City, select a city from the list.
The corresponding Latitude, Longitude, and Time Zone values are displayed.

Exact location. Enter values for Latitude and Longitude.
Internet Mapping Service: For Project Address, enter the street address, city and state, or latitude and longitude of the project, and click Search.

Please ensure your True North is correctly set up so that sun angles are correct in LUX Walker.

Optimize your model.
---------------------------------------------

When exporting to VR keep in mind that it needs to run as fast as possible so that the user does not experience motion sickness.
Too many digital lines and geometries will slow down the project.

There are many ways to increase performance and optimize your models:
•	Hide elements and categories not required for discussion.
•	Limit your view distance.
•	Remove Complex Geometry and Unnecessary Detail.
•	Create a section box around what you would like to showcase.
o	Have a less detailed master plan
o	Section box areas or parts of the project with more detail.
•	Use objects and Vegetation from the LUX Walker Library.

Unnecessary Elements and Categories:
Each category in Revit is exported as a Layer to LUX Walker.
Please disable categories and elements you do not need to see in VR.

Usually:
Massing, Entourage, Planting
[VR TEMPLATE]

View Distance:
Rendering distance has a massive impact on performance in LUX Walker. The panorama tool allows you to load in a panorama which you can use to create realistic context for your buildings.
If you absolutely need to load in a large 3D site model, make sure you section box so your building is as close to the centre as possible. If you do not do this you might have problems finding your project when LUX Walker has loaded.
 
Complex Geometry and Detail:
When in doubt or the project runs slowly switch to wireframe view in Revit and inspect the file for complex objects. Anything that appears solid from a distance in wireframe mode can cause issues and slow downs. Use items from LUX Walker library where possible.


Section Box and Model Variations:
When dealing with large projects with may units/structures/spaces to show. Make different exports.
•	Export a masterplan .WALK file without any furniture or details.
	Please make sure these elements are also off in your Linked Revit Files.
•	Create detail section box models of rooms or parts of the building.
•	You can enable and disable linked files in your layer tool in LUX Walker.
o	By linking in two different variations of a project you can switch between them using the layer panel.
