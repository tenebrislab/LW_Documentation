Please disable items, groups, components and layers you do not need to see in VR.
It is sometimes best to purge your file before export.  - Make a backup before purging.

 We recommend running `Cleanup 3 for Sketchup <https://extensions.sketchup.com/en/content/cleanup%C2%B3>`_. to clean unnecessary items. It has built in purge functionality.
